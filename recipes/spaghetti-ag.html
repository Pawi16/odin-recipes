    <li>Olive oil</li>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Cook the spaghetti in a generously-salted pot of boiling water until it is just one minute shy of being al dente.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, about 3 minutes after you add the pasta to the boiling water, heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and crushed red pepper flakes and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the garlic is lightly golden.</li>
    <li>Once the pasta is ready to go, use tongs to transfer the pasta immediately to the sauté pan, along with 1/2 cup of the hot starchy pasta water. Toss the pasta continuously until it is evenly coated in the garlic sauce. If the sauce looks a bit too dry, add in another 1/4 cup of the starchy pasta water.</li>
    <li>Give the pasta a quick taste add an extra pinch of salt and/or crushed red pepper flakes if needed.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately while it's nice and hot, garnished with any toppings that sound good.</li>
